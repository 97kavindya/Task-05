After dinner that evening Tarzan strolled forward, where he remained
until after dark, in conversation with the second officer, and when
that gentleman's duties called him elsewhere Tarzan lolled lazily by
the rail watching the play of the moonlight upon the gently rolling
waters.  He was half hidden by a davit, so that two men who approached
along the deck did not see him, and as they passed Tarzan caught enough
of their conversation to cause him to fall in behind them, to follow
and learn what deviltry they were up to.  He had recognized the voice
as that of Rokoff, and had seen that his companion was Paulvitch.

Tarzan had overheard but a few words:  "And if she screams you may
choke her until--"  But those had been enough to arouse the spirit of
adventure within him, and so he kept the two men in sight as they
walked, briskly now, along the deck.  To the smoking-room he followed
them, but they merely halted at the doorway long enough, apparently, to
assure themselves that one whose whereabouts they wished to establish
was within.
